Python script to extract membrane resistance (100-ms long-lasting hyperpolarizing square pulse 400 ms) before a single whisker-evoked PSP. First crops the recording where the seal test is performed under current-clamp conditions, and then fits an exponential function to extrapolate the RIM. Try it using the "Evoked_PSP.abf".
