# Electrophysiology_Analysis
**Under construction.

This is a repository of all the python scripts created to analyze in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings in current-clamp configuration. All the electrophysiology traces correspond to layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex, recorded under urethane anaesthesia. For further information about recordings, please see: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13664

Important: all the scripts explore pyabf to import abf files into python (more info: https://pypi.org/project/pyabf/)

**Feel free to contact me (tiago.campelo@u-bordeaux.fr) if you have any question or suggestion to improve the code.

PS: I am new into Python (aka "noob") and, as consequence, the performance of these code might be close to a potato.
