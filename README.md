# Electrophysiology_Analysis
**Under construction**.

Repository of all python scripts used to analyze *in vivo* whole-cell patch clamp recordings in a current-clamp configuration.
All recordings were obtained from layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex, recorded under urethane anaesthesia. A detail explanation of the experimental pipeline can be foun here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13664.

See also https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.999094v1 to see the analysis performed with the Python scrips here available.

All the scripts explore **pyabf** module to import "abf files" into python (see for information: https://pypi.org/project/pyabf/)
