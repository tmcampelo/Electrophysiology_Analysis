Python code to quantify spotaneous Vm activity (urethane-anaesthesia).
It remove spontaneous spikes, quantifies Vm distribution, UP state probability and cumulative Vm (with baseline included).
It also contains crops of all the UP states to quantify their number, average amplitude (mV) and the size (FWHM).
